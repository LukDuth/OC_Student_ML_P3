Anticipez les besoins en consommation de bâtiments (Anticipate consumption needs of buildings in Seatle)

This all the work I've done for OC IML project n°3. The goal was to learn how to use/optimize/adapt/evaluate different regression algorithms, with an open database about buildings in Seatle (2015 and 2016). In the end, we had to predict their electrical consumption and their CO2 emission.
